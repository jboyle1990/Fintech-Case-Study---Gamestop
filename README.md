## GameStop: 1984 -2021

Historically, Gamestop has been a successful specialty retailer offering video game products and other related merchandise. At it's peak the company operated over 5,000 locations and earned over 9 billion in revenue annually.

As business started to stagnate in 2010-2016 the company made a number of unsuccessful acquisitions to attempt to revitalize business. The challenge that management faced was that they focused on revitalizing the current model of business instead of forecasting where Gamestop could thrive in an evolving industry.

  These acquisitions include:
  * EB Games in 2005 for $1.44 Billion
    * Chain focused on selling used video games 
  * MovieStop in 2004 for undisclosed amount
     * Chain focused on selling used & new movies
  * Free Record Shops in 2008 for undisclosed amount
     * Chain focused on reselling used records
   * BuyMyTronics in 2012 for undisclosed amount
     * Chain focused on selling used electronics online
   * Simply Mac in 2012 for undisclosed amount
     * Chain focused on repairing Apple products

Eventually, the company's complacenacy and lack of forward thinking led to a group of activist investors to present a detailed prsentation on where the company should be focusing their efforts. The thesis of this presentation was that the company should be looking to cut costs and invest in higher margin operations (item 2 in the appendix - GameStop Restore Presentation). 

..... Enter Ryan Cohen.

## GameStop: 2021 - Current

Estimates have the video game industry growing to as much as $217 Billion by 2023. It's puzzling that a retailer who has a specialty in this industry hasn't found a way to capture or grow alongside this industry.

Areas of  growth include:

* Hardware sales
  * Compnents 
  * Consoles
  * Accessories
* Esports
  * Merchandise
  * Branding opportunities
* Online Viewership (Twitch & Youtube)
  * Estimated 26 million viewers in 2021

### Leadership Change

By November of 2020 Ryan Cohen, founder of Chewy, had built a 12% stake in the company and began urging the board of directors for action.

In a letter that Ryan wrote to the Gamestop board of directors in Novemeber of 2020 he cleary identified the current issues the company faced and the consequences of their lack of actions.

  * It is equally important to stress that GameStop hasfailed to adequately keep pace with key industry developments in recent years, including:
      * The transition from physical hardware to digital streaming.
      * The explosion of mobile.
      * The shift to purchasing from mass retailers and other online competitors.
   * By not capitalizing on these shifts, GameStop has lost billions of dollars in annual revenue and squandered a massive amount of market share. The Board cannot run from the        following facts:
      * Sales have plunged from $9.5 billion in fiscal year 2011 to $6.4 billion in fiscal year 2019.
      * Annual EBITDA has dropped from $839 million in fiscal year 2011 (before the last console cycle) to
      only $111 million in fiscal year 2019.
      * Net income has fallen off a cliff from $339 million in fiscal year 2011 to a staggering loss of $470
       million in fiscal year 2019.
      * In the two most recent quarters alone, the Company has lost another $277 million.
      * To add insult to injury for GameStopâ€™s stockholders, the size of the global gaming market has grown
       by more than 2.5x since the last console cycle.3"

By June of 2021 Ryan had been appointed Executive Chairman and will be the driving force behind whatever changes are implemented at Gamestop.

One of the more interesting developments post appointment was that Gamestop began hiring blockchain developers and a Gamestop "nft" website went live.

### End Credits

Gamestop is uniquely positioned to leverage existing relationships, their captial on hand, and early entry to the Ethereum blockchain into a full blown company transformation. The company is looking toward a future where they are no longer reliant on brick and mortar stores to maintain profitability. Future growth verticals include blockchain products (whatever they may be) and an emphasis on a robust online product offering to rival any traditional competitor (Amazon included).  While, we don't know where these changes will lead, it's incredibly exciting that new leadership was able to identify the emergance of blockchain technology and look to embrace the omnichannel retail model through signifcant investment in thier online offerings.

Power to the Players.
