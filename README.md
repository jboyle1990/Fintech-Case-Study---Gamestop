## GameStop: 1984 -2021

Historically, Gamestop has been a successful specialty retailer offering video game products and other related merchandise. At it's peak the company operated over 5,000 locations and earned over 9 billion in revenue annually.

As business started to stagnate in 2010-2016 the company made a number of unsuccessful acquisitions to attempt to revitalize business. The challenge that management faced was that they focused on revitalizing the current model of business instead of forecasting where Gamestop could thrive in an evolving industry.

  These acquisitions include:
  * EB Games in 2005 for $1.44 Billion
    * Chain focused on selling used video games 
  * MovieStop in 2004 for undisclosed amount
     * Chain focused on selling used & new movies
  * Free Record Shops in 2008 for undisclosed amount
     * Chain focused on reselling used records
   * BuyMyTronics in 2012 for undisclosed amount
     * Chain focused on selling used electronics online
   * Simply Mac in 2012 for undisclosed amount
     * Chain focused on repairing Apple products

Eventually, the company's complacenacy and lack of forward thinking led to a group of activist investors to present a detailed prsentation on where the company should be focusing their efforts. The thesis of this presentation was that the company should be looking to cut costs and invest in higher margin operations (item 2 in the appendix - GameStop Restore Presentation).

## GameStop: 2021 - Current

Estimates have the video game industry growing to as much as $200 Billion by 2023. It's puzzling that a retailer who has a specialty in this industry hasn't found a way to capture or grow alongside this industry.

### End Credits

Gamestop is uniquely positioned to leverage existing relationships, their captial on hand, and early entry to the Ethereum blockchain into a full blown company transformation. The company is looking toward a future where they are no longer reliant on brick and mortar stores to maintain profitability. Future growth verticals include blockchain products (whatever they may be) and an emphasis on a robust online product offering to rival any traditional competitor (Amazon included).  While, we don't know where these changes will lead, it's incredibly exciting that new leadership was able to identify the emergance of blockchain technology and look to embrace the omnichannel retail model through signifcant investment in thier online offerings.

Power to the Players.
