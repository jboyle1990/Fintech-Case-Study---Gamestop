## GameStop: 1984 -2021

Historically, Gamestop has been a successful specialty retailer offering video game products and other related merchandise. At it's peak the company operated over 5,000 locations and earned over 9 billion in revenue annually.

As business started to stagnate in 2010-2016 the company made a number of unsuccessful acquisitions to attempt to revitalize business. The challenge that management faced was that they focused on revitalizing the current model of business instead of forecasting where Gamestop could thrive in an evolving industry.

  These acquisitions include:
  * EB Games in 2005 for $1.44 Billion
    * Chain focused on selling used video games 
  * MovieStop in 2004 for undisclosed amount
     * Chain focused on selling used & new movies
  * Free Record Shops in 2008 for undisclosed amount
     * Chain focused on reselling used records
   * BuyMyTronics in 2012 for undisclosed amount
     * Chain focused on selling used electronics online
   * Simply Mac in 2012 for undisclosed amount
     * Chain focused on repairing Apple products

Eventually, the company's complacenacy and lack of forward thinking led to a group of activist investors to present a detailed prsentation on where the company should be focusing their efforts. The thesis of this presentation was that the company should be looking to cut costs and invest in higher margin operations (item 2 in the appendix - GameStop Restore Presentation). 

..... Enter Ryan Cohen.

## GameStop: 2021 - Current

Estimates have the video game industry growing to as much as $217 Billion by 2023. It's puzzling that a retailer who has a specialty in this industry hasn't found a way to capture or grow alongside this industry.

Areas of  growth include:

* Hardware sales
  * Compnents 
  * Consoles
  * Accessories
* Esports
  * Merchandise
  * Branding opportunities
* Online Viewership (Twitch & Youtube)
  * Estimated 26 million viewers in 2021

### Leadership Change

By November of 2020 Ryan Cohen, founder of Chewy, had built a 12% stake in the company and began urging the board of directors for action.

In a letter that Ryan wrote to the Gamestop board of directors in Novemeber of 2020 he cleary identified the current issues the company faced and the consequences of their lack of actions.

  * It is equally important to stress that GameStop hasfailed to adequately keep pace with key industry developments in recent years, including:
      * The transition from physical hardware to digital streaming.
      * The explosion of mobile.
      * The shift to purchasing from mass retailers and other online competitors.
   * By not capitalizing on these shifts, GameStop has lost billions of dollars in annual revenue and squandered a massive amount of market share. The Board cannot run from the        following facts:
      * Sales have plunged from $9.5 billion in fiscal year 2011 to $6.4 billion in fiscal year 2019.
      * Annual EBITDA has dropped from $839 million in fiscal year 2011 (before the last console cycle) to
      only $111 million in fiscal year 2019.
      * Net income has fallen off a cliff from $339 million in fiscal year 2011 to a staggering loss of $470
       million in fiscal year 2019.
      * In the two most recent quarters alone, the Company has lost another $277 million.
      * To add insult to injury for GameStopâ€™s stockholders, the size of the global gaming market has grown
       by more than 2.5x since the last console cycle.3"

By June of 2021 Ryan had been appointed Executive Chairman and will be the driving force behind whatever changes are implemented at Gamestop.

One of the more interesting developments post appointment was that Gamestop began hiring blockchain developers and a Gamestop "nft" website went live.

## The "Playing" Field

### Legacy Competitors

* Best Buy
* Target
* Wal-Mart
* Amazon

### Emerging Competitors 

* Opensea
  https://opensea.io/
* Axie Infinity
  https://axieinfinity.com/
* MetaHero
  https://punkscomic.com/planetdao.html

### Market Environment

Brick and mortar competition will reamin largely stagnant. Big box stores who don't specialize in the gaming sector will continue to provide a "one stop shopping" experience. 

Emerging competition includes an NFT marketplace and two blockchain based games. The blockchain based games represent an emerging model of gaming where players are earning rewards for their involvement on the platform. This model could become a significant threat to Gamestop's current core relationship base (Microsoft, Sony, Nintendo). The differnece in Gamestop combating the emerging competitors may be their capital. Gamestop has over a billion dollars in cash and multiple lines of credit where these emerging companies are working with capitalizations in the tens of millions.

## How to beat the "Game"?

Below are three reccommendations for Gamestop moving forward. These three recommendations would help position the company to capitalize on blockchain technology as the world moves to widespread adoption in this sector. Gamestop would also have significant leverage with current business partners to strengthen the exisitng business model.

### Leverage Current Partnerships

Gamestop remains the only specialty "video game" retailer. While a number of big box stores carry these products, none exclusively exhibit video games. Gaming giants such as Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo do not have dedicated retail space to sell their products so a specality retailer could exert a significant amount of leverage when negotiating with these companies.

These partnerships could also provide incredible synergy with the upcoming Gamestop NFT platform. This will be outlined further below.

Another area where Gamestop to leverage these relationships is to continue to expand online offerings to encompass all strategic partners' products outside of the video game sector.

Evidence has grown that Gamestop plans to rival Amazon in the online retail space with significant investment in their fulfillment netweork and expanded online product offering.

### Explore Blockchain Products

#### Game Exchange - NFT Platform

A large reason why Gamestop thrived in the early 2000s was that they purchased used games from customers and resold thaem. However, that model became obsolete as gaming moved to a digital model.  There simply isn't a need for physical disks. I'm proposing an NFT platform where the customer digital game downloads are "NFTs". This would assign digital ownership to the customer. In turn, the Gamestop NFT platorm could act as a marketplace for gamers to buy and sell used games. 

Currently, a majority of the digital game marketplace is dominated by a company called Steam. 

Benefits for an "NFT" based used game model:

* Gamestop could capture resale revenue from each purchase
* Customers would feel empowered to use the Gamestop Ecosystem by selling used games on the platform
  * Steam doesn't allow customers to resell games
* Game Developers could capture a small amount from each sale 
  * incentivizing the best developers to publish games on your platform
  * developers are currently frustrated with the current online publishing platforms because they take too large of a revenue cut

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91380617/135703591-98b493e7-098d-4bc1-b60d-e40b00b01012.png)

We don't have Steam's revenue past 2017 (they were acquired) we do know that the gaming industry experienced explosive growth. Per our chart above the industry grew 15% from 2017 to 2018. It's a confident assumption that Steam tracked with the overall market.

Providing a direct competitor to Steam would help bolster fear that a "discless" video game future would drive Gamestop to bankrupcy. 

#### Pop Culture - NFT Platform

What better way to supplement product sales then to sell digital merchandise branded by the hottest games in the industry?

This would be performed by creating a digital marketplace similar to OpenSea, who sold a billion dollars worth of NFTs in August. This would tie in nicely to the marketplace we discussed above. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91380617/135704035-eae985c0-41bb-4ba3-990b-9bc62ab20064.png)

Imagine buying a digital copy of the latest game and you get a serialized NFT that promotes the game you purchased. The NFT would could be rare or common but either way you would be a part of a proud communitity that cherises the individual game.

For reference, an example of NFTs would be to create a product that resembles NBA Topshot (but for videogame IP):

Based on the OpenSea sales numbers it's clear that the world values these digital objects and it would be foolish not to aggressively pursue a fraction of this market. 

### In-Store Services Suite

* Computer Build services
* Gaming Cafe
* Board Game Cafe
* Offer in Store perks for "Power Up" Reward Members

This suite of in store services would allow Gamestop to increase profitability and drive traffic at locations.  The logic behind the gaming and board game cafe would allow current locations to offer rentable areas in current stores where consumers could sample product or compete against friends. The computer build services would allow employees to assist consumers in the daunting task of building their own gaming PC. These services would help increase profitability via low overhead services and help to monetize areas of current locations.

## Saving our Progress 

### End Credits

Gamestop is uniquely positioned to leverage existing relationships, their captial on hand, and early entry to the Ethereum blockchain into a full blown company transformation. The company is looking toward a future where they are no longer reliant on brick and mortar stores to maintain profitability. Future growth verticals include blockchain products (whatever they may be) and an emphasis on a robust online product offering to rival any traditional competitor (Amazon included).  While, we don't know where these changes will lead, it's incredibly exciting that new leadership was able to identify the emergance of blockchain technology and look to embrace the omnichannel retail model through signifcant investment in thier online offerings.

Power to the Players.
